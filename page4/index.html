                        <h1 style="color: white;">Overview</h1>
                        <p style="color: white;">A limited liability partnership is a corporate body that is distinct from its participants’ legal identities and is established and incorporated under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008. The succession of a limited liability partnership is unending. A limited liability partnership’s rights, obligations, and continued existence will not be impacted by a change in its partners.</p><br>

                        <h2>What Is a Limited Liability Partnership?</h2>
                        <p style="color: white;">An LLP is a type of business structure that combines the flexibility of a regular partnership firm with the advantages of a private limited company, such as limited liability and independent legal entity. It provides both the advantages of a corporation and a partnership firm into one organisational structure. <span style="color: black;">Despite the fact that the firm has numerous partners, no one is held accountable for the activities of others, It relieves them of taking on any unnecessary responsibility for the actions of others.</span></p><br>

                        <h2>Important Things to Be Kept in Mind Before Starting an LLP</h2>
                        <p>Before registering your LLP, make sure you have an expert in the field to help you draft your LLP Agreement, as well as help you and your LLP partners obtain their respective DIN registrations. Every LLP should mandatorily have at least two designated partners. One of the partners must be a resident of India, which means he/she must have stayed in India for at least 182 days.</p><br>

                        <h2>How an LLP Is Formed</h2>
                        <p>Here are the steps involved in the formation of an LLP:</p><br>
                        <div id="secondol" style="color: white;">
                            <ol>

                            </ol>
                        </div>
                        <br>

                        <h2>What is FiLLiP?</h2>
                        <p>To make LLPs easier to incorporate, the Government brought in some changes to the registration process in September 2018. These came into force from October of the same year. Forms 1 and 2 were replaced by Reserve Unique Name-Limited Liability Partnership or RUN-LLP and Form for incorporation of Limited Liability Partnership, or Form FiLLiP, respectively. Both these forms will be sent to and verified by a Registrar as appointed by the Central Registration Centre. These forms were introduced to make it easier to register and run such firms. And to reduce the time required to incorporate them. FiLLiP may also be used to acquire DPINs if the LLP has only two partners.</p><br>

                        <h2>Tax Benefits Of Limited Liability Partnership</h2>
                        <p>Some of the tax benefits an LLP offers are:</p>
                        <div id="thirdul">
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>No tax is levied on the income of the partners</p></li>
                                <li><p>No dividend distribution tax is payable under Section 40B</p></li>
                                <li><p>Partner remunerations, including bonus, commission, interest, are allowed as a deduction</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <p>In addition, there are other tax-saving benefits that entrepreneurs can avail of by registering as LLP.</p><br>

                        <h2>Remuneration to LLP Partners According to the Income Tax Act</h2>
                        <p>The most important thing for an LLP partner is remuneration or how much they will be getting from the company. Remuneration includes everything from base salary to bonuses and commissions. The LLP agreement contains all the details of partner remunerations. Some of the key points to know about the amount deductible under the IT Act are:</p>
                        <div id="fourthul">
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>Deduction is possible only if the remuneration is received by a working partner or individual</p></li>
                                <li><p>The remuneration received by the partners is taxed as Business Income. Share of profit is not included in the same section as remuneration</p></li>
                                <li><p>For both working and non-working members, the share of profit returns is exempted as per Section 10(2A) of the <a href="https://vakilsearch.com/income-tax-return-filing-online">Income Tax</a> Act</p></li>
                                <li><p>Interest received on the capital invested by them is also taxed as Business Income.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <br>

                        <h2>Statutory Compliance Requirements for an LLP</h2>
                        <p>An LLP is easy to maintain, relative to a private limited company. For example, you need not have an auditor until you cross ₹40 lakh in turnover or have a paid-up capital of over ₹25 lakh. Also, in the absence of shareholders (the partners own the company themselves), the compliances are severely reduced.</p><br>
                        <p>But LLPs do have some compliance requirements for LLP like filing of annual returns, statement of accounts and solvency, maintaining minutes of a meeting of partners, and books of accounts, etc.</p><br>

                        <h2>Annual e-Filing for a Limited liability Partnership</h2>
                        <p style="color: white;">Similar to the requirements for <a href="https://vakilsearch.com/company-registration">company registration in India</a>, LLPs must file their Statement of Accounts & Solvency on or before October 30 of every financial year. The annual return for LLPs is due on May 30 every year, even if the LLP has not undertaken any business in that specific financial year.</p><br>
                        <p>For e-filing on LLP, you can download the e-form, fill it up offline and submit it for further processing. There is also a choice to fill it up online using the facility to pre-fill the data available in the LLP system.</p><br>

                                <li><p>LLPs are easy to form with fees ranging from ₹500 to ₹5600</p></li>
                                <li><p>Partners enjoy less risk as they do not have unlimited liability. Their personal assets will not be dissolved if the company comes under debt, making LLP’s a safer option</p></li>
                                <li><p>LLPs are easier to manage as the Board has more power. Shareholders have little power as far as the management of the company is concerned and this makes them easier to govern</p></li>
                                <li><p>Joining and leaving the company is easy as there are no restrictions on transferring or leaving a Limited Liability Partnership</p></li>
                                <li><p>They have an unlimited life, making perpetual succession a reality. An LLP is not affected by things like death or retirement and hence, the smooth functioning of the firm is assured</p></li>
                                <li><p>LLPs enjoy several tax benefits. They also do not require compulsory audits unless their income exceeds ₹40 lakhs.</p></li>

                        <h2>What Are the Disadvantages of an LLP?</h2>
                        <div id="fifthul">
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>As LLPs provide entrepreneurs with several tax benefits, not all states in India encourage them. This leads to severe restrictions in some states, making it hard to set up such companies in those states.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Mostly, we find that there is a lack of communication between the partners in such companies, leading to several of them making decisions without consulting others.</p></li>
                                <li><p>LLPs are yet to be accepted as a fully credible source of investment as they are still relatively new. It will take a while for the general mindset to change, and for such firms to become as credible as private limited companies</p></li>
                                <li><p>While there are no restrictions on transferring power in LLPs, this is a long and complicated procedure, making the process lengthy and cumbersome.</p></li>

                        <h2>LLP v. Private Limited Company</h2>
                        <p>Although both the entities have similar features there are slight differences which entrepreneurs must be aware of. The cost of setting up and registering an LLP is much cheaper when compared to a private limited company.</p><br>
                        <p>An LLP is flexible, easy-to-maintain with less compliance and no compulsory audits below the prescribed threshold. Whereas private limited companies’ require many compliance filings with the MCA. Both the business structures are considered to be separate legal entities and both are transferable. But a private limited company is more flexible in terms of transferring the ownership.</p><br>

                        <div style="background-color: black; color: white; padding: 15px;">
                            <h4>What is the minimum partner required in LLP?</h4>
                            <p>A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) requires a minimum of two partners for its formation.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h4>Can LLP give salary to partner?</h4>
                            <p>LLPs can distribute profits among partners, but technically, salaries are not paid. Instead, partners receive a share of the profits based on the partnership agreement.</p>

                            <h4>Which is better, LLP or Pvt Ltd company?</h4>
                            <p>The choice between LLP and Private Limited Company depends on factors like liability, regulatory compliance, and the scale of operations. Pvt Ltd offers limited liability and is more suitable for larger businesses, while LLP is simpler with less compliance but also has some limitations.</p>

                            <p>LLP is best for small businesses, startups, or professional services where flexibility, fewer compliance requirements, and shared management are valued. It provides a middle ground between a traditional partnership and a private limited company.</p>
